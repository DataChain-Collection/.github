## 🧠 What is IdentityChain?

**IdentityChain** is a decentralized DataDAO focused on enabling secure, compliant, and user-owned identity verification.  
<!-- Users submit encrypted identity data and receive verifiable credentials (VCs) issued under zk-SNARK validation, without exposing sensitive information. -->

The data can be used for KYC/AML processes across DeFi, fintech, and reputation systems — always under the user's control.  
IdentityChain rewards participation and allows contributors to govern rule updates, validator behavior, and access policies.

## 🔧 Built on OpenKYCChain

**OpenKYCChain** is an open-source framework that defines reusable smart contracts and zk-enabled verification flows for on-chain KYC/AML compliance.  
<!-- It includes a DID registry, credential issuance logic, and zk identity scoring models.-->

IdentityChain is the first applied use case of OpenKYCChain.  
**OpenKYCChain is extensible and supports additional compliance models, risk scoring, and multi-jurisdictional adaptations.**

## 🚀 Aligned with Vana Academy

IdentityChain is being developed as part of the **Vana Academy**, a 9-week accelerator designed to launch user-owned DataDAOs.

We are progressing through the following phases:

- **Bootcamp & Discovery (Weeks 1–3)**  
  Understanding the Vana ecosystem, architecture, token standards, and consent-driven data models.

- **Building Phase (Weeks 4–5)**  
  Finalizing our FHIR data subset, designing smart contracts, and refining the token and governance model.

- **GTM Sprint (Weeks 6–8)**  
  Launching the MVP, defining tokenomics, and preparing for adoption and integration.

- **Demo Day (Week 9)**  
  Presenting IdentityChain to investors, builders, and the broader Vana ecosystem.

## 🎯 Mission

- 🔐 Enable KYC/AML compliance without sacrificing user privacy
- 🧾 Replace centralized identity verification with verifiable credentials and zk-proofs
- 🧠 Use AI to support risk scoring and pattern detection for AML
- 🗳️ Empower users to govern identity policies and validator behavior

---

## 🔍 Use Cases

- Consent-based KYC for DeFi onboarding
- Portable digital identity across multiple platforms
- DAO and validator governance for AML rules
- Monetization of identity insights through tokenized access

---

## 🔍 Under Exploration

We are currently refining the architecture of OpenKYCChain, and evaluating privacy-preserving mechanisms, smart contract design, and token utility models.  
Our aim is to align every component with regulatory best practices and the modular architecture of the Vana protocol.
