## **Phase 2: Building Phase (Weeks 4â€“5)**
**Objective:** Design and prototype a technical solution for smart agriculture.

### **Key Activities**
1. **Architecture Design:**
    - Define how IoT sensors (e.g., soil sensors, drones) connect to Vanaâ€™s blockchain.
    - Use IPFS for raw data storage and blockchain for cryptographic hashes to reduce gas costs .

2. **IoT Integration:**
    - Configure physical sensors or simulators for real-time data (e.g., soil temperature, livestock location).
    - Connect sensors to Vana via APIs to register data on the blockchain .

3. **AI Model for Predictive Analytics:**
    - Train AI models (e.g., XGBoost, LSTM) to predict pests, droughts, or crop yields using historical data tokenized in Vana .
    - Example: Detect plant diseases via drone imagery and computer vision models .

4. **Smart Contracts & DataDAO:**
    - Write smart contracts to:
        - Authorize data access via DAO tokens.
        - Distribute rewards to farmers for contributing data to AI models .

5. **Privacy & Security Testing:**
    - Validate that sensitive data (e.g., crop locations) is encrypted and accessible only via decentralized permissions.

### **Key Activities**
1. **MVP Development:**
    - Integrate all components (IoT + AI + Vana) into a functional app.
    - Example: A platform where farmers monitor crops in real-time and receive pest alerts predicted by AI .

2. **Tokenomics Design:**
    - Define how tokens (e.g., $AGRI, $DATA) incentivize users:
        - Rewards for sharing sensor data.
        - Discounts on AI-driven analytics (e.g., pest prediction) .

3. **Community & Marketing Support:**

Create a decentralized platform where farmers, researchers, and agritech firms share agricultural data via Vana, using AI for optimization and blockchain for integrity.

### **Architecture Overview:**
```
IoT Sensors (soil moisture, temperature)  
           â†“  
[Backend API] â†’ Send data to Vana (hash on blockchain, raw data in IPFS)  
           â†“  
[AI Model] â†’ Predictive analytics (pests, droughts)  
           â†“  
[Smart Contracts] â†’ Distribute DAO tokens to farmers  
           â†“  
[Dashboard] â†’ Visual results, permission management  
```  

### **User Flow Example:**
1. **Data Registration:**
    - A soil sensor measures conditions and logs data in Vana.

2. **AI Analysis:**
    - AI processes historical data to predict drought in the region.

3. **Incentivize Participation:**
    - Farmers earn $DATA tokens for sharing data used to train AI models.

4. **Third-Party Access:**
    - An agritech firm requests access to anonymized datasets.
    - Farmer approves via their digital wallet.

### **Revenue Model:**
| Source | Description |  
|--------|-------------|  
| **DAO Tokens** | Farmers earn tokens for data sharing. |  
| **AI Services** | Charge for predictive analytics (e.g., $10/month for pest alerts). |
