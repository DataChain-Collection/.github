# 🧬 NutriDAO

> A community-owned DataDAO for ethical contribution and activation of supplement usage data.  
> Powered by **OpenFHIRChain** — a modular framework for bringing FHIR medical standards to the blockchain.

## 🌱 What is NutriDAO?

**NutriDAO** is a decentralized, user-owned data collective focused on the voluntary contribution and ethical activation of supplement usage data.  
Participants contribute their data to a **Data Liquidity Pool (DLP)** — a smart contract that tokenizes their contributions and ensures consent-based access, control, and rewards.

This data can be used to train AI models and power personalized wellness applications — always under user consent.  
NutriDAO rewards participation and gives contributors a voice in how their data is accessed, used, and monetized.

## 🔧 Built On OpenFHIRChain

**OpenFHIRChain** is an open-source framework that brings a subset of the HL7 FHIR healthcare data standard to Web3.  
It provides modular smart contracts and IPFS integration to store and manage FHIR-compliant resources on-chain.

NutriDAO is the first real-world implementation of OpenFHIRChain.  
**OpenFHIRChain is extensible and can support additional FHIR resources in future DataDAOs.**

## 📍 Current Stage

NutriDAO is currently in **Week 3** of the [Vana Academy Accelerator](https://vana.com), in the ideation and prototyping phase.  
We are defining the core FHIR subset, drafting smart contracts, and mapping out the user data consent flow.

👉 See the [Roadmap →](./ROADMAP.md)
